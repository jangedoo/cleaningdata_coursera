Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
==========================

All the code required to clean up the data is in the file *run_analysis.R*. Each step is commented and should be easy to follow. A library called 'sqldf' has been used for easy grouping and aggregation operation.

Please see CodeBook.md file for more details about the approach.

The script will write the "tidy data" to the disk upon completion.
